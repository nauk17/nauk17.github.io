Humm, there are many choices and it makes me confusing. Back in the past, when I was a college freshman, at this time and also the first time, I was approached the concept of software in a real working environment that is the backend, frontend, database design,&hellip;And during college time, I tried the mobile field with IOS using Swift, the challenge myself with Machine Learning. Finally, in the current time, I will concentrate totally on building my backend skills. Reveal a litle, blockchain is a target field in my future tunnel :D.</p>

<p>In this post, I am willing to show my programming language which I choose is Golang&hellip;that&rsquo;s great!</p>

<h2>First step&hellip;Choosing a programming language</h2>

<p>Ahw, nothing to say about this, you can find Golang strengths by searching in Google&hellip;At first glance, it has simple syntax, strong concurrency, and support by Google.
This is the best choice for me to develop my backend skill.</p>

<p>Aha, you can see, my first step is done&hellip;</p>

<h2>What is the offical tutorial for your programming language?</h2>

<p>Hum, as mentioned above, Golang is designed at Google, a giant technical company and the best way to learn is through the offical tutorial. The list that you can follow is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://tour.golang.org/">A tour of Go</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://hongthele.blogspot.com/2018/11/concurrency-trong-go.html">Tutorial by Le The Thong</a> (Vietnamese version)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://gobyexample.com/">Of course, golang by example</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://jeiwan.net/posts/building-blockchain-in-go-part-1/">Building Blockchain in Go</a> with 7 series</p></li>

<h2>Finally</h2>
