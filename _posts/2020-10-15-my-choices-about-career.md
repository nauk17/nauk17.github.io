# The choices about my career

Recently, I had been decided what kind of software industry field which should be followed. Humm, there are many choices and it makes me confusing. Back in the past, when I was a college freshman, at this time and also the first time, I was approached the concept of software in a real working environment that is the backend, frontend, database design,...And during college time, I tried the mobile field with IOS using Swift, the challenge myself with Machine Learning. Finally, in the current time, I will concentrate totally on building my backend skills. Reveal a litle, blockchain is a target field in my future tunnel :D.
